# Explanation
I used node.js with express to create a an app where the user can create a login and be able to use the app to post within the app.

with node.js and express I was able to utilize mongoDB to create a database to store information like users and posts.

i used CSS to style my page and HTML/ejs to display my information.

Approach
I use the Trello board to design the approach a user would take once inside the app. I was able to design it with a Wireframe. With those two ready I was able to move forward with my node.js and express app to input my functionality.
